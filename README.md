A simple keylogger in Python is a program that captures and records every key pressed on a keyboard. Keyloggers are often used for monitoring user activity, either for legitimate purposes like parental control or security monitoring, or for malicious purposes like stealing passwords.

How a Keylogger Works
At its core, a keylogger listens for keyboard events (like key presses) and records these events, typically to a file. The Python programming language, with its rich set of libraries, makes it relatively easy to create a basic keylogger.

Key Components of a Simple Python Keylogger
Keyboard Event Listener:

A keylogger needs to monitor the keyboard to capture keystrokes. This is typically done using an event listener that detects whenever a key is pressed.
Logging the Keystrokes:

The captured keystrokes are then saved to a file (or sent somewhere else). This file can be reviewed later to see what was typed on the keyboard.
Running the Keylogger:

The keylogger typically runs in the background, silently logging keystrokes without the userâ€™s knowledge.
